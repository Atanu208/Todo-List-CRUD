Key Features:
- **Task Management:** Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks. The application employs a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach to handle tasks effectively.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application's user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive. Users can easily add tasks, mark tasks as complete, edit task details, and remove tasks.

- **Real-time Updates:** Firebase is used as the backend database, providing real-time data synchronization. This means that any changes made by one user (e.g., adding or updating tasks) will be immediately reflected for all users accessing the application.

- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are stored securely in the Firebase database, ensuring that user data remains accessible even after closing or refreshing the application.

- **URL Access:** The application is hosted on Surge, allowing users to access it through the provided URL (https://crabby-twig.surge.sh/). This enables learners to interact with the application without needing to set up their own local development environment.

This application serves as a practical example for beginners to learn about React components, state management, and basic CRUD operations in the context of web development. By utilizing Firebase for data storage and real-time updates, learners can explore how modern web applications leverage cloud-based databases to enhance user experiences.
